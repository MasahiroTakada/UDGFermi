\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

\section{Model}
\label{sec:model}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Describe how to compute the luminosity of DM annihilation 
    signal for ultra diffuse galaxies
    \item Describe ingredients of NFW model ($grizy$ SED fitting, mass-to-light ratio, 
    NFW profile, concentration, boost factor due to substructures)
\end{itemize}

\section{Sample (TBD)} 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Describe the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam survey
    \item Describe the sample of UDGs (refer Johnny's paper)
    \item Fermi data (Section 3 in \url{http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0067-0049/199/2/31/pdf})
    \item Show the best-fit SED for each of 8 UDGs
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}

\begin{itemize}
    \item 95\% CL upper limit on the DM cross section from 
    each of 8 UDGs, and the stacked result
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Impact of model variations on the results
    \item Discuss the results when using $\sim$500 UDGs
    \item Discuss prospects for the full HSC survey and LSST
    \item Discuss pros and cons of this method compared with dSphs constraints (stress advantages of point source-like targets)
    \item Discuss implications for Magic/HESS and CTA (HAWC: TeV DM) 
\end{itemize}

% The bibliography will probably be heavily edited during typesetting.
% We'll parse it and, using the arxiv number or the journal data, will
% query inspire, trying to verify the data (this will probably spot
% eventual typos) and retrive the document DOI and eventual errata.
% We however suggest to always provide author, title and journal data:
% in short all the information that clearly identify a document.
